Titanium Alloy Slider Menu _or_ zIndex is your friend

A colourful example of a slider menu within a TabGroup. 

All of the styles are within the view (xml) so you can see how it all works. Ideally
these would go into a tss.

N.B. If you start splitting out windows into their own files (e.g. using Require)
you'll need to add a Ti.App event for the menuWindow slide action and for menu clicks.
